Loom Version 104 <https://loom.cc>
Written by Patrick Chkoreff

Loom is a open source web server.  All code in this directory is subject to the
license conditions described in the "NOTICE" file.

Loom provides two basic concepts known as the "Grid" and the "Archive".  In
short:

	The Grid is a two-dimensional array of integers.
	The Archive is a one-dimensional array of strings.

These arrays are huge, with 128-bit row and column numbers in the range 0
through 2^128-1.

The server has a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for
manipulating these arrays, allowing fully independent developers to create
their own applications and user interfaces.

The server also has a "Wallet" interface built on top of the Grid and Archive,
allowing users to log into the web site, create new asset types, and spend them
around freely in a cash-like manner.

The server does not do SSL (Secure Socket Layer) by itself.  For that, you need
to run it behind the "pound" front-end, which handles all the SSL and then
communicates with the Loom back-end in simple plain text.  See
http://www.apsis.ch/pound/ for details.


= NOTES ON PORTING DATA (2011-01-01)

On 2011-01-01 I released a new version of the code which uses the file system
for all data storage, with no central locks, instead of a GNU DB file with a
central lock.  Here is the procedure I used to ensure a correct and orderly
transition.

Shut down server:

	loom -n

Install new code.

Port the GNU DB to the new file system based data store:

	port_data

Now check the old DB:

	old_audit_loom -s >tmp1

And check the new DB:

	audit_loom -s >tmp2

The files should be the same, except that tmp2 will have an extra message
about type zero.

	diff tmp1 tmp2
	rm tmp1 tmp2

Run the self-test:

	test_loom

Start the server:

	loom -y

Now we'll run the stress test for the API.  First you may have to configure the
data/conf/test_api_stress file and pre-populate the two locations with usage
tokens.  Then run:

	test_api_stress
